# DSA Practice Roadmap

This repository tracks a consistent, structured journey through Data Structures & Algorithms from foundations to interview readiness.

## Goals

- Build strong problem-solving skills.
- Understand concepts deeply (not just memorize solutions).
- Improve speed and pattern recognition through repetition.
- Prepare confidently for technical interviews.

---

## Monthly Learning Plan

### November — Arrays & Core Problem-Solving
Focus on building basic data structure understanding and problem-solving habits.

**Topics:**

- Arrays

**Focus:** Learn how to iterate, manipulate data, and use two-pointers, hashing, and stack logic.

---

### December — Linked Lists, Strings & Basic Algorithms

**Topics:**

- Linked Lists
- Strings
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Merge, Quick Sort, etc.)

**Focus:** Recognize when binary search applies, and understand complexity trade-offs.

---

### January — Recursion, Stacks & Tree Basics

**Topics:**

- Stacks
- Trees

**Focus:** Understand hierarchical & connected data. Learn traversal patterns.

---

### February — Binary Trees & Graph Foundations

**Topics:**

- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Graphs (BFS / DFS)

**Focus:** Learn to break down problems, recognize overlapping subproblems, and when greedy strategies work.

---

### March — Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms

**Topics:**

- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Famous / Classic Problems

**Focus:** Learn to break down problems, recognize overlapping subproblems, and when greedy strategies work.

---

### April & Beyond — Advanced Topics & Interview Preparation

**Topics:**

- Backtracking
- Heaps
- Tries
- DP on Strings
- Greedy + Heap Patterns
- DP on Trees
- Mixed Concept Problems
- Advanced Graph Problems

**Also:**

- Mock Interviews
- Systematic Review of Weak Topics
- Timed Practice

---

## Recommended Weekly Routine

- **Solve 1–2 problems daily** (Consistency > Quantity)
- **Review mistakes weekly**
- **Re-solve old problems** to build memory

---

## Final Note

This journey is about **mastery**, not speed.
Progress compounds.
Stay consistent. Keep learning. You will get there.

💡 _"A little progress each day adds up to big results."_
